Superheroes and abilities have always existed in the human imagination. Marvel has one of the largest superhero comic book franchises. Famous superheroes, including Spider-Man, Iron Man, Captain America, and Thor, are among its cast, as are well-known superhero teams like the Avengers, X-Men, Fantastic Four, and Guardians of the Galaxy. Additionally, it has famous supervillains, including Doctor Doom, Magneto, Ultron, and Thanos, in its stable. Most of Marvel's fictional characters function in a single reality known as the Marvel Universe, with many of their headquarters located in New York City.
